# A Consumer-Centric Approach to RESTful API Design

This is a book I started writing in early 2014. I'd like to eventually get it published. Currently, it feels a bit on the
shorts side, weighing in at ~55 pages.

## Installation and Building

To install LaTeX, run the following from a debian distro:

```
sudo apt-get install texlive
```

Or, if you use OS X, you might be able to install [MacTeX](https://tug.org/mactex/).

Then, to build the book, run the following command:

```
./build.sh
```

The book will be available as `book.pdf`.
